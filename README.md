##CS 5103 Course Project: Software Engineering Practice##

Schedule: 
Mar. 10th: Requirements, implementation (with repo link), unit tests, and readme file (describing how to run your code) for the first batch of requirement. 
Mar. 31th: Requirements, implementation (with the same repo link), unit tests, and readme file (describing how to run your code) for the second batch of requirement. 
Apr. 28th: Requirements, implementation (with repo link), readme file, for the last batch of requirement, design change report (reporting the design principles and design  
patterns you used if any), tool application report (reporting the results and experience of using automatic tools mentioned above). 

Code Example:
from word_stats import count_words
print_stats("I love coding.  Don't you love coding?")

Unit testing is working in Visual Studio Enterprise 

First Sprint: count words between tokens
Second sprint: count lines and characters
Third sprint: replace words (case sensitive and whole words only) 

To run this code, you can execute main.py.  It will print out a few examples then bring up a while true loop that accepts input and spits out statistics.
Enter \q to this prompt to quit.
